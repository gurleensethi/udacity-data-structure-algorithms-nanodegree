# Problem 6

To solve this problem we have to iterate over the unsorted array
once and maintain two variables minimum and maximum, whenever we see a
value that is less that the minimum or greater that the maximum we
update the variables accordingly.

Time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is O(1).
