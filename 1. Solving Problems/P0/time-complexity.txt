Task 0:

  The time take by this program is O(1), considering that indexing a list for first and last position takes a
  constant amount of time regardless the number of entries in it.

  However, if you take into consideration the code that is required read and build the list, the complexity goes
  to O(n), because we have to read n number of lines.

Task 1:

  The time taken for the entire program is O(t + c), where 't' is the number of text records
  and 'c' is the number of call records. The reason is we have to iterate over both the lists.

Task 2:

  The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where 'n' is the number of calls.
  We iterate over the list of call records and keep the track of number and thier total duration.
  Simultaneously we update the variable that keeps track of the number that spent the most time.

Task 3:

  The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of call records.
  We iterate through the list of call records once to find the area codes called by banglore numbers,
  and the percentage of banglore to banglore calls.

  If we condiser the list.sort() method, then the total time complexity becomes O(n log(n))
