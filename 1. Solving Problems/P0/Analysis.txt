Task0
-----
Time complexity of this solution is O(1), because array indexing takes a constant amount of time.

Task1
-----
Time complexity of this solution is O(N + M), where N is number of texts and M is number of calls.
This can be written as O(N) where N is the total input.

Task2
-----
Time complexity of this solution is O(N) where N is number of calls, because we need to iterate
over the list of calls once.

Task3
-----
Time complexity of this solution is O(N) where N is the number of call records, because we iterate
over the list of calls once.
list.sort() (which has a complexity of O(N log(N))) has been used to sort the list and display the result. 
Conseding it in the final result, the complexity becomes O(N) + O(N log(N)) = O(N log(N)).

Task4
-----
Time complexity of this solution is O(N + M), where N is number of calls and M is number of texts.
This can be written as O(N) where N is the total input.
list.sort() (which has a complexity of O(N log(N))) has been used to sort the list and display the result. 
Conseding it in the final result, the complexity becomes O(N) + O(N log(N)) = O(N log(N)).
