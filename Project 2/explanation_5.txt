To implement the block chain I have used LinkedList.

A new block is added to the head of List, which makes the
insertion O(1).

To make the hash unique regardless of the data being entered
I have hashed the data along with current timestamp.
It takes a constant (C) amount of time to calculate a hash.

The space complexity is O(N * C) where N is the number of blocks
in a blockchain and C is the total data held inside a block. This
can also be written as O(N).
