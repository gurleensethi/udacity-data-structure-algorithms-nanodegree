I have used recurssion to solve this problem.
1. Iterate over the list of files in current path.
2. Save the item to list if it satisfies the criteria.
3. If any of the path is a sub-directory, repeat step 1 with the path.
4. Append all the paths found from Step 3 to the current list.

The number of times we have to iterate is equal to total number of files
and sub-directories present inside a directory and all of its sub-directories.
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number files + sub-directories
at all levels inside a directory.
