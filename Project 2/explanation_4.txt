I have modified the Group class to hold user is a dictionary (Map), insted
of an array. This allows us to check for existance of a user in a particular
group in O(1).

is_user_in_group is a recursive function that will find the existance of a
user in a group or in all of its sub-groups.
Time time complexity of this opeartion is O(N) where N is the total number
of sub-groups + 1 (the group itself) inside a given group.
